# monte carlo prototype -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# intro ----------------
# When one has a generative model of a domain but no analytical solution, one uses monte-carlo simulation. It's a
# class of techniques using random sampling a draw from a distribution. Solutions for problems can be calculated
# using repeated draws and aggregating the results.
# 1. create domain model
# 2. generate random draws from the distribution
# 3. deterministic output calculation
# 4. compute aggregate statistics
